# find_nearest_meteorites
Find the meteorites  that landed closest to Chennai using Python and NASA data

#Running
This package requires Python3 and requests package. 

I forgot to add .gitignore file. So add it during repository creation and include Pipfile.lock in the .gitignore file

Python code is inside a folder named python_code making it easy for packaging purposes

First install pipenv. Then:

```
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv run "python python_code/python_practise.py"
```
