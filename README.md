Find the meteorites  that landed closest to Chennai using Python and NASA data

#Running
This package requires Python3 and requests package. I forgot to add .gitignore file. So add it during repository creation and include Pipfile.lock in the .gitignore file

First install pipenv. Then:

```
pipenv install
pipenv run "python python_practise.py"
```
